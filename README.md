# GA-for-NN-Architecture-Optimization
This repository implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize feedforward neural network architectures for classifying Farsi vowel audio data. The project evolves network architectures to maximize validation accuracy and explores the effects of hyper-parameters on GA performance.
